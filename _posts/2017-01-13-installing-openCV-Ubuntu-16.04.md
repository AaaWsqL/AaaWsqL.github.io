Before installing OpenCV, I needed to know about Cmake,which is a tool used to build C++ projects particularly when building projects that have multiple sub directories, or projects that are to be deployed to multiple platforms.

Well, I found a good enough introduction here at [Derek Molley](http://derekmolloy.ie/hello-world-introductions-to-cmake/)'s site.
