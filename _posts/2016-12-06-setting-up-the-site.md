Finally got the motivation to set up own website. It took me like 3-4 hours to put this site together.
However the credits goes to Github-pages, Jekyll, [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) whose guide helped me a lot and [Ankit Sultana](https://github.com/bk2dcradle/researcher)'s template is the main reason behind the look of this site. 

Hope there will be more posts to follow!
